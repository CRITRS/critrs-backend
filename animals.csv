1,"Koala","Phascolarctos cinereus","Vulnerable","mammal","","","Koalas are agile climbers with sharp claws. Their diet is almost entirely eucalypt leaves. They sleep most of the day and are active for about four hours at night. Koalas are mostly solitary but can be seen in large groups where densities are high."
2,"Humpback Whale","Megaptera novaeangliae","Vulnerable","mammal","","","Humpback Whales migrate to warmer Australian waters in Hervey Bay and the Great Barrier Reef to breed in winter months. They feed on plankton."
3,"Australian Fur-seal","Arctocephalus pusillus","Near Threatened","mammal","","","Australian Fur Seals change their diet from season to season, eating squid, octopus and fish. Killer Whales and White Sharks are probably their main predators."
4,"Swamp Wallaby","Wallabia bicolor","Endangered","mammal","","","Swamp Wallabies feed on the leaves of shrubs, ferns and grasses. They are active during the day, but are shy and usually solitary."
5,"Platypus","Ornithorhynchus anatinus","Endangered","mammal","","","Platypus use sensory organs in their bill to detect prey, which includes larval mayflies, caddisflies and small molluscs. The Platypus is one of the only mammals to lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young. Females lay two eggs in a nursery burrow, which then take two weeks to hatch."
6,"Red Kangaroo","Macropus rufus","Least Concern","mammal","","","Red Kangaroos are the world's largest living marsupial, but at birth, like all Kangaroos, they are only about the size of jelly beans and not very developed. Breeding does not occur in times of drought. Red Kangaroos are active from dusk until dawn in small groups, but often feed in larger groups (mobs). They are considered pests by some farmers because they compete with stock for grass."
7,"Southern Hairy-nosed Wombat","Lasiorhinus latifrons","Endangered","mammal","","","Hairy-nosed wombats are social animals that live in small colonies in burrow systems (warrens), usually dug in limestone or calcrete. Wombats are primarily nocturnal but sometimes venture out on warm days in winter and spring. When startled they can reach speeds of up to 40 km per hour. Young are born in late winter and spring after a pregnancy of about 22 days and occupy a backward-facing pouch. Sexual maturity is not until about 3 years of age and animals can live for more than 15 years."
8,"Sugar Glider","Petaurus breviceps breviceps","Near Threatened","mammal","","","Sugar Gliders can glide for 50 m between trees. They have a distinctive 'yip yip' call that sounds like the yapping of a small dog. Young are carried on the mother's back until they are able to care for themselves. Sugar Gliders feed on gums, nectar, pollen and invertebrates."
9,"Black Flying-fox","Pteropus alecto","Least Concern","mammal","","","The Black Flying-fox is a migratory species that roosts in large numbers high in the tree canopy during the day. At dusk, individuals fly out to feed on blossom and fruits, and return to their roost at dawn. Mating occurs in March to April when large males establish a territory on a branch. They congregate into large camps during spring and summer, when birthing occurs."
10,"Tasmanian Devil","Sarcophilus harrisii","Endangered","mammal","","","Devils can roam large distances in search of food. Mainly a scavenger with a very varied diet, they will eat almost anything they come across. Its powerful jaws allow it to consume its prey entirely - bones and fur. They can often be heard screaming and squabbling over carcasses, the noise and display being part of the animal’s social hierarchy. The Devil is the largest extant carnivorous marsupial and fossil evidence suggests they used to be found across the Australian mainland. Devil numbers have been in serious decline due to the Devil Facial Tumour Disease."
11,"Quokka","Setonix brachyurus","Vulnerable","mammal","","","Quokkas are secretive and rare on the Mainland of south-west WA and their population and distribution has suffered serious declines since European settlement in WA. On Rottnest and Bald Island their populations are large and healthy. Mostly nocturnal, though they can be seen during the day on Rottnest Island. Browses and grazes on a variety of plant matter."
12,"Dugong","Dugong dugon","Endangered","mammal","","","May occur in herds when feeding. Long lived (up to 70 years) and does not breed until at least 6 years old. Males fight each other to mate with females and breeding only occurs every few years (can be an interval up to 7 years)."
13,"Mahogany Glider","Petaurus gracilis","Endangered","mammal","","","Relatively new to science, very little is known about the natural ecology and behaviour of the mahogany glider. These nocturnal animals are arboreal and can glide between the treetops for distances of up to 60 m by stretching out their membrane. Individuals are mainly solitary, spending the day asleep in tree hollows and the nights foraging within their home range, which may be up to 23 hectares in size. These gliders feed on exudates such as the sap and gum of eucalypt and acacia trees, and also take gum from the floral spears of grass trees. Nectar, pollen and even insects and spiders also make up an important part of the diet."
14,"Brush-tailed Rock-wallaby","Petrogale penicillata","Endangered","mammal","","","A social species typically living in small colonies in steep and rocky terrain. They are highly agile and also ascend trees. Daylight hours are usually spent in a specific rocky shelter, which they defend. Towards evening they emerge to sun themselves and feed on grasses. Seeds, fruit and flowers will also be eaten. Now rare, having disappeared from many sites especially in the west and south of its distribution. Due to an escape of a pair in 1916, a small breeding population of the brush-tailed rock-wallabies also exists on the island of Oahu in Hawaii."
15,"Eastern Quoll","Dasyurus viverrinus","Endangered","mammal","","","Eastern Quolls are solitary and mainly nocturnal, scavenging and hunting at night and sleeping during the day in grass-lined dens in burrows or under fallen logs. They are widespread in Tasmania, but only a small number have been sighted on the Australian mainland in the last 50 years. They feed mostly on insects, but will take small mammals or birds as prey and occasionally eat fruit."
16,"Common Wombat","Vombatus ursinus","Near Threatened","mammal","","","Common Wombats dig burrows with their sharp claws and powerful short limbs. In winter, females give birth to a single young. Their teeth grow in response to wear. They occasionally enter people's tents at campsites looking for food."
17,"Lumholtz's Tree-kangaroo","Dendrolagus lumholtzi","Least Concern","mammal","","","Lumholtz's tree-kangaroo lives in small, loose-knit groups of three to five, consisting of a male and female mates. Each kangaroo maintains a "home range" and will be hostile towards a member of the same gender that enters it. It is named after the Norwegian explorer Carl Sofus Lumholtz."
18,"Eastern Grey Kangaroo","Macropus giganteus","Least Concern","mammal","","","Eastern Grey Kangaroos feed mainly on grasses and herbs, but sometimes eat leaves from trees and shrubs. They are active mostly from dusk to dawn, often in large groups (mobs)."
19,"Australian Magpie","Cracticus tibicen","Least Concern","bird","","","Magpies are well known for their carolling calls at dawn and dusk. Males defend their territory, especially when breeding."
20,"Major Mitchell's Cockatoo","Lophochroa leadbeateri","Vulnerable","bird","","","They occur in pairs or small flocks and occasionally in many hundreds when food is abundant. They feed mostly on seeds on the ground or in the foliage of shrubs and trees but will also gouge insect larvae (grubs) out of branches. Named after one of Australia's early explorers."
21,"Tawny Frogmouth","Podargus strigoides","Least Concern","bird","","","Tawny Frogmouths rest on tree branches during the day, using their colour pattern to look like part of the branch."
22,"Little Penguin","Eudyptula minor","Least Concern","bird","","","Little Penguins are the smallest of the world's penguins. They make nests in crevices between rocks or burrows in the sand dunes."
23,"Little Raven","Corvus mellori","Least Concern","bird","","","Attracted to agricultural or grazing lands, or places of abundant food, such as rubbish tips and bins. Also attracted to roadkill, which puts them at risk of becoming roadkill themselves."
24,"Galah","Eolophus roseicapillus","Least Concern","bird","","","Galahs often flock in large numbers in farmland areas where food is abundant. They eat seeds."
25,"New Holland Honeyeater","Phylidonyris novaehollandiae","Least Concern","bird","","","New Holland Honeyeaters feed on nectar, insects and honeydew. They may breed at different times of year in different parts of Australia."
26,"Rainbow Lorikeet","Trichoglossus haematodus","Least Concern","bird","","","Rainbow Lorikeets usually occur in pairs. Both males and females feed the young, but only the females incubate the eggs. In Australia they feed primarily on nectar from the eucalyptus."
27,"Carnaby’s Black Cockatoo","Calyptorhynchus latirostris","Endangered","bird","","","Breeding from early July to December. Nesting in hollows of old eucalypts. Only the female incubates and broods the chick. Migrates south and west after breeding. Call a “weeyou-weeyou” or longer “weeeloo-weeeloo”."
28,"Red Wattlebird","Anthochaera carunculata","Least Concern","bird","","","Male Red Wattlebirds call with a loud cackle, like a cough. Females respond with a whistle."
29,"Wedge-tailed Eagle","Aquila audax","Least Concern","bird","","","Wedge-tailed Eagles are Australia's largest eagle. They can travel long distances and often circle in thermal air currents. They feed on live prey or dead carcases (carrion)."
30,"Sulphur-crested Cockatoo","Cacatua galerita","Least Concern","bird","","","Sulphur-crested Cockatoos breed in hollows in old growth trees. They make loud, harsh calls that can be heard from a distance. They eat fruits and seeds."
31,"Superb Fairy-wren","Malurus cyaneus","Least Concern","bird","","","Superb Fairy-wrens form family groups that co-operate to raise young in a single nest. They mainly eat insects, but also some seeds and fruit, and forage in groups."
32,"Australian pelican","Pelecanus conspicillatus","Least Concern","bird","","","Australia's only species of pelican. They occasionally form small flocks and help one another to feed by surrounding fish and herding them together."
33,"Southern Cassowary","Casuarius casuarius","Endangered","bird","","","It forages on the forest floor for fallen fruit and is capable of safely digesting some fruits toxic to other animals. They also eat fungi, and some insects and small vertebrates. The southern cassowary is a solitary bird, that pairs only in breeding season."
34,"Willie Wagtail","Rhipidura leucophrys","Least Concern","bird","","","Willie Wagtails are usually found singly or in pairs. They feed on insects, usually catching them in flight, and sometimes eat small lizards. They are highly territorial and call repeatedly at night when breeding to advertise their territory."
35,"Kookaburra","Dacelo novaeguineae","Least Concern","bird","","","Laughing Kookaburras hunt by perching on branches and swooping onto their prey below. Small animals, such as insects and worms, are eaten whole. Larger prey, such as small snakes and mammals, may be bashed against tree branches and other hard objects before being eaten. Laughing Kookaburras form breeding pairs for life."
36,"Emu","Dromaius novaehollandiae","Vulnerable","bird","","","Emus walk steadily with a precise gait, and run swiftly. They are seen most often in pairs, families or loose flocks up to dozens. Male Emus build flat nests on the ground and incubate the eggs without eating, drinking, defecating or leaving the nest for around 55 days."
37,"Noisy Miner","Manorina melanocephala","Least Concern","bird","","","Noisy Miners assist each other to raise their young and often form large groups. They actively defend their territories from intruders and aggressively exclude smaller birds. They eat mainly insects and nectar but occasionally feed on small lizards and amphibians."
